*** Overview

+ The Bivrost theme provides a clean, north-bluish appearance.
+ It defines several color constants such as =bivrost0=, =bivrost1=, etc.
+ The region highlight is now fixed to the _frost_ style with predetermined colors.
+ This also demonstrate how to load the theme using =use-package=.

*** Color Configuration and Explanation

+ The theme assigns colors directly via hex values.
+ For example:
  1. =bivrost0= is set to =#242424=.
  2. =bivrost4= is set to =#4C566A=.
+ The comment face is defined as =bivrost-comment= which is set to =#616e88=.
+ The region highlight is hard-coded to the _frost_ style:
  + The foreground is =#2E3440=.
  + The background is =#88C0D0=.

*** Theme Code Example

Below is an example of the updated theme code that assumes true color is always available and uses the _frost_ region highlight option.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((class '((class color) (min-colors 89)))
        (bivrost-region-highlight-foreground "#2E3440")
        (bivrost-region-highlight-background "#88C0D0")
        (bivrost0 "#242424")
        (bivrost1 "#3B4252")
        (bivrost2 "#303035")
        (bivrost3 "#434C5E")
        (bivrost4 "#4C566A")
        (bivrost5 "#b2b2b2")
        (bivrost6 "#E5E9F0")
        (bivrost7 "#ECEFF4")
        (bivrost8 "#8FBCBB")
        (bivrost9 "#88C0D0")
        (bivrost10 "#81A1C1")
        (bivrost11 "#5E81AC")
        (bivrost12 "#BF616A")
        (bivrost13 "#D08770")
        (bivrost14 "#EBCB8B")
        (bivrost15 "#A3BE8C")
        (bivrost16 "#B48EAD")
        (bivrost-annotation "#D08770")
        (bivrost-attribute "#8FBCBB")
        (bivrost-class "#8FBCBB")
        (bivrost-comment "#616e88")
        (bivrost-escape "#D08770")
        (bivrost-method "#88C0D0")
        (bivrost-keyword "#81A1C1")
        (bivrost-numeric "#B48EAD")
        (bivrost-operator "#81A1C1")
        (bivrost-preprocessor "#5E81AC")
        (bivrost-punctuation "#D8DEE9")
        (bivrost-regexp "#EBCB8B")
        (bivrost-string "#A3BE8C")
        (bivrost-tag "#81A1C1")
        (bivrost-variable "#D8DEE9"))
    )
#+END_SRC

*** Using use-package for Theme Setup

+ The =use-package= macro helps manage and load the theme with minimal configuration.
+ Ensure that the theme file is in your =load-path= or package repository.
+ Here is an example configuration if you have the theme installed locally.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package bivrost-theme
    :ensure nil    ; Set to nil for local installation; change if installing from a package repository
    :init
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/bivrost/")
    :config
    (load-theme 'bivrost t))
#+END_SRC

*** Summary

+ The Bivrost theme uses a set of fixed color values to deliver a unique, arctic appearance.
+ The obsolete customization for region highlight has been removed and is now fixed to the _frost_ style.
+ Using =use-package= simplifies the installation and loading of the theme.
+ Modify the color constants in the code block if you desire a personalized tweak.
